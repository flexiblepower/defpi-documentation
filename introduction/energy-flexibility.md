# Energy Flexibility in the Energy Transition

For many years, power grids have formed a reliable infrastructure, which transports power
generated at power plants towards domestic, commercial and industrial consumers.
However, the way we use the power grid is changing. First of all, we are using electricity for
new energy intensive applications such as heating buildings and transportation. Secondly,
we are introducing renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines, which do
not provide steady levels of production. Finally, energy is being generated at a small scale
by devices such as solar panels and micro-CHP’s, which means that power has to be
inserted at many different locations in the power grid.

These three trends have a high impact on the stability of the power grid itself. Charging
electric vehicles requires enormous amounts of power. Instead of a continuous flow from
power plant towards consumers, generation becomes much more fluctuating because most
renewable energy sources cannot deliver a steady and continuous power production. Solar
panels produce energy only when the sun is shining. During the night or when it is cloudy,
very little or no energy is generated. Wind turbines do not produce power when there is too
little, or too much, wind to safely turn the blades of the turbine. As such, renewables often
have an intermittent character and cannot be planned in advance. Additionally, the electricity
flows in the power grid are changing, because energy is inserted into the grid at different
locations, such as from households.

These trends introduce two problems for the power grid: First of all, it becomes more difficult
to balance the production and consumption in the power grid. When production and
consumption are not in balance, the power grid will fail. Having many renewable energy
sources means that there still need to be traditional power plants available which can
produce electricity when there is no renewable energy available. Secondly, as the usage of
electrical heating and electrical vehicles increases, the transportation capacity of the power
grid will soon be inadequate. Increasing the capacity is very costly. A distribution system
operator (DSO), the owner of the power grid, would like to avoid or postpone these
investments as much as possible.

Sometimes consumers are willing to provide some flexibility in the energy consumed or
produced by their devices. For example, an electric vehicle doesn’t have to start charging
right away when it is plugged in in the afternoon if the owner doesn’t need the car until the
next morning. By adding ICT and intelligence to the power grid, we could schedule the car to
start charging during the night when there is more capacity or renewable energy available in
the power grid. A power grid which is made more intelligent with this technology is called a
Smart Grid. The system that automatically schedules consumption and production is called
the Smart Grid service.
