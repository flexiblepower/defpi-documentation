# User interface

The web-based user interface enables users to interact with the orchestrator in a user-friendly way. Communication between the user interface and the orchestrator occurs via the exposed REST API. 

Users are able to manage their nodes via the public node pools, or private nodes tied to specific users.

The user interface also provides an overview of the available services that can be deployed on the runtime environment. These services can then be deployed as processes and connections can be instantiated between processes.
