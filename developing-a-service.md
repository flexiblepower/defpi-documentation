# Developing a Service

For the development of new services for dEF-Pi, build tools are available that generate a code base for developers. This ensures that the new service is compatible with the dEF-Pi platform.

This also relieves developers in the process of creating a new service, and requires them to only code the actual implementation of the service and its interfaces. 

In [Development Process](developing-a-service/development-process.md) the shared steps of creating a new service for either Java or Python are discussed. And the specific steps for [Java](developing-a-service/java-tutorial.md) and [Python](developing-a-service/python-tutorial.md) follow up on the shared steps.
