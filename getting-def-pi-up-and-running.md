# Getting dEF-Pi up and running

Deploying a dEF-Pi cluster with an orchestrator and new nodes is done via available Docker compose templates and using Docker Swarm commands.

The tutorial to get an dEF-Pi environment up and running is divided into three parts: running dEF-Pi on Linux, create a cluster, create a demo environment.

First a single node environment on a Linux node is explained. This environment can be extended with new nodes.

When the dEF-Pi environment is ready, a demo environment can be created by instantiating services and creating connections between compatible interfaces of two running processes.
